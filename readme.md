# Mogeko Castle Gaiden: Github Madness

This project is a public fan-game of Mogeko Castle that can be modified without any rules, so you can change levels, dialogue, graphics, coding and everything else.

The only rule is: once it is not buildable it will be reverted.

Since the real Gaiden will never come out, we made our own. With code. And probably more bugs than the castle has Mogekos.

NOTE: if you want to use anything from this repository please contact the person who made said thing before using it.
